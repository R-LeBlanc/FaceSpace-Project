## Goal

Create a site that will serve up Facespace! Oh, and learn a little more about React, routing, Node and CSS along the way.

## The Homepage

## The Profile Page

When you click on a character's image on the homepage, it'll take you too that character's profile page.
Here you can see that charcter's friends aswell as a quote from that character.

## The Sign In Page

You can click on the sign in link in the header and be taken to the sign in page. When signed in the sign in link changes to a greeting, and the charcter's friends are shown with an symbol on their profile picture.
